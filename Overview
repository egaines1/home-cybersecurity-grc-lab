# 🏠 Home GRC Cybersecurity Lab

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates foundational GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) cybersecurity skills using a realistic home environment. It simulates a complete risk assessment lifecycle, aligned with CIS Controls and MITRE ATT&CK, with full documentation and policy creation to mirror real-world compliance tasks.

## 📋 Asset & Risk Summary
All risk-related data is organized in the `Home_GRC_Risk_Assessment.xlsx` file, which includes the following sheets:
- **Asset Inventory**: A list of home devices with CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) ratings
- **Risk Assessment**: Threats, vulnerabilities, and qualitative risk ratings
- **Risk Treatment Plan**: Defined strategies to mitigate or accept risk
- **MITRE ATT&CK Map**: Threats aligned with real-world techniques and IDs

## 🛡️ Controls & Framework Mapping
Each risk was mapped to specific CIS Controls v8 with control type classifications:
- Preventive
- Detective
- Corrective

This showcases the ability to create technical and administrative security control strategies aligned to industry standards.

## 📄 Security Policy
This project includes a full governance document in the form of a Home Information Security Policy, outlining security expectations, acceptable use, incident response, and consequences for policy violations.
